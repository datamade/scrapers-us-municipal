    def _version_rank(self, version):
        '''
        This method overrides `LegistarAPIBillScraper._version_rank`.

        Traditionally, matter versions are numbered in ascending order, e.g.,
        the highest version number denotes the most recent version. By contrast,
        most New York City Council matters have one version labeled with an
        asterisk (*).

        Instead of numbers, NY City Council orders versions by letter, where
        the last letter alphabetically indicates the most recent version.

        A very small number of bills introduced prior to 2000 have a "0"
        version. These are artifacts of reconciling poor formatting and should
        be reported to Council admin for removal.

        `version_map` contains possible versions and their recency ranking,
        where a higher ranking means a more recent version.

        Params

          :version (str) - '*', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D'

        Returns

          integer value indicating position of given version relative to other
